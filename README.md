This repo has been developed to review the Application Platform options on Azure for hosting Container deployed applications. 


## PaaS options on Azure for hosting Container workloads on Azure 

This repo has been developed to review the Application Platform options on Azure for hosting Container deployed applications. 

The scope covers the following services capable of hosting container workloads:

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
	Simplify the deployment, management, and operations of large scale container workloads
	
- Azure Functions 
	Fully managed serverless functions, deploy functions to Azure Function App for Linux Container after every successful build
	
- Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)
	Fully managed container-based workloads platform, jointly operated with Red Hat
	
- Container Instances (ACI)
	Easily run containers on Azure without managing servers
	
- Web App for Containers
	Easily deploy and run containerized web apps that scale with your business
	
- Azure Batch
	Azure Batch Service is a cloud based job scheduling and compute management platform that enables running large-scale parallel and high performance computing applications efficiently in the cloud.
